INTEGRATION PROJECT 

We are 4 UPPA Licence 2 informatique students working on an hospital management webapp.

Project name : e-mergencies

Supervisor : DIEGUEZ LODEIRO Martin

This project is made by MARTINS Maximiliann, BUESSARD Matthieu, DUPUIS Jules and SILVA Gorka

==============================================

INSTALLATION STEPS

1) Copy the "webapp" directory in a web server (ex: in the "www" directory of wamp server)

2) Import the "database_full_simplified.sql" file in phpmyadmin. To do so, manually create an empty database and name it "e-mergencies", then go to "Import" and select the sql file.

3) Go to "localhost/webapp/index.php" on your browser

4) Use, for exemple, the following credentials to test the login : 
 - Patient : id= , pw=
 - Hospital staff : id= , pw=
 - Administration : id= , pw=
 - Wrong credentials : id=test@test.com , pw=test

==============================================

DATABASE INFORMATION

There are 2 versions of the database. We made the first one for a complete study of an hospital management. It regroups the entity-relationsheep diagram, the Merise analisys and the "database_empty.sql" file.
On another side, there is the simplified version we used for developing and testing. This is the one you should use to test the webapp. It regroups 2 sql files : "databse_empty_simplified.sql" and "database_full_simplified".
